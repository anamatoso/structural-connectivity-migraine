# Structural Connectivity Changes in Episodic Migraine

This repository consists of the code used in order to detect structural alterations in episodic migraine using graph theory metrics. It was done in the scope of my Master Thesis in Biomedical Engineering.

It is divided into 3 main files: `main_analysis.m`, `main_comparisons.m` and `ISMRM23.m`.

The first file ([link](https://github.com/anamatoso/structural-connectivity-migraine/blob/main/matlab_scripts/main_analysis.m)) is responsible for the analysis between groups. It is dependent on several functions that were developed by me. They can be divided in 6 groups/objectives according to the following images:
